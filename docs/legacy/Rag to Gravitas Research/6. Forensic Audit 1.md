These files confirm that the codebase is significantly behind the v4.0 Spec


| Component | v4.0 Requirement | Current Code Reality | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Config | gemma2:27b | codellama:7b (app/config.py) | 🔴 DRIFT |
| Memory | Qdrant + MinIO | CHROMA_URL hardcoded (app/config.py) | 🔴 CRITICAL FAIL |
| Ingestion | Hybrid (Dense+Sparse) | Simple Chunking (app/ingestor.py) | 🟠 LEGACY |
| Hardware | Dual-GPU Awareness | check_vram checks all GPUs but doesn't isolate (app/L1_local.py) | 🟠 RISK |
| MCP | Needs Qdrant | Calls container.memory (which is currently Chroma) | 🔴 BROKEN |

Assessment: The system is currently "Brain Dead" regarding the new Memory Architecture. The container.py connects to services that don't match the new spec.

Ready for the final batch (Likely memory.py, reflex.py, router.py, safety.py). Once received, I will instantly generate the Migration Work Order.
