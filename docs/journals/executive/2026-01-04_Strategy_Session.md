# 🎯 STRATEGY SESSION: GRAVITAS GROUNDED RESEARCH (2026-01-04)
## Objective: Transition from "Local Rig" to "Community Cognitive Mesh"

This document serves as the "Source of Truth" for the architectural and philosophical pivot discussed during the Thinking Phase on January 4th, 2026.

## 1. THE "LIBRARIAN DEPARTMENT" (Multi-Agent Workforce)
To handle the complexity of multi-tenant, federated research, the single Librarian script is replaced by a specialized department:

*   **Intake Clerk:** Manages drag-and-drop ingestion, performs L1 summarization, and assigns files to "Missions" (Folders).
*   **Research Librarian:** Executes **Federated Search** across isolated silos (Personal, Group, Sanctuary Feed) without data leakage.
*   **Archivist:** Manages the 30-day "Heartbeat" (Retention) and the "Eternal Outbox" (Email Archival).
*   **Synthesis Clerk:** The "Bridge" that identifies tensions and contradictions between grounding layers (The Synthesizer logic).
*   **Vault Manager:** Oversees encryption at rest, user isolation, and freemium storage quotas.

## 2. TIERED GROUNDING ARCHITECTURE (The Mesh)
Grounding is no longer a flat file search. It is a "Stack of Layers":
1.  **Personal Pouch:** Private thoughts, past chats, and journal entries.
2.  **Group Circle:** Shared documents for small groups, families, or teams.
3.  **Sanctuary Feed:** High-authority, time-sensitive documents (e.g., sermons) pushed by Group Owners/Ministers.
4.  **The Commons:** General web imports and public research.

**Conflict Resolution (The Synthesizer):** Gravitas will not prioritize one layer over another. It will present the tension between them (e.g., "Your personal note says X, but the current Group study suggests Y").

## 3. THE "ETERNAL OUTBOX" LIFECYCLE
We reject the "Delete from View but Keep for Admin" enterprise model. **Delete means Delete.**

*   **The 30-Day Heartbeat:** All records have a 30-day pulse.
    *   **Chats:** If not renewed, they are **Automatically Emailed** to the user (Gmail as long-term storage) and then purged from Gravitas.
    *   **Documents:** If not renewed (by clicking), they are **Hard Purged**. No redundant copies are sent to email.
*   **The Eternal Outbox:** Emailing findings/transcripts defaults to the Account Owner's email.

---

## 4. THE VAULT (Native Storage Experience)
*   **No Permission Friction:** Gravitas features an internal, native storage service (The Vault). No reliance on third-party cloud links (Dropbox/Drive).
*   **Freemium Model:** Users get a generous free tier for research. Power users and institutions can upgrade to the **"Great Library" Tier (2TB)** for permanent, non-expiring ingestion of thousands of books.
*   **Privacy:** Physical/Logical isolation between user/group indexes is the "Trust Moat."

---

## 5. THE LIVE DOCUMENT CANVAS (UX)
The UI moves beyond "Chat Scrolling." 
*   **Active Editing:** Documents (emails, books, code) are "Live Entities" in the Vault.
*   **Direct Manipulation:** The user gives natural language commands to the AI to "surgeonsically" edit the document (e.g., "Change the salutation" or "Add a thought here") without re-pasting the text.

---

## 6. PHILOSOPHICAL GUARDRAILS
*   **Consumer Grade:** Not a legal record-keeping system.
*   **Thinking Enhancement:** Optimized for cognitive clarity, research, and community sharing.
*   **Managed Service:** The Developer (me) handles the 3-layer brain (L1/L2/L3) and prompt engineering. The user handles the "Missions" and "Folders."
