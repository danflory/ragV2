# GRAVITAS - GRANULAR THOUGHT LOG (Execution Stream)
---
💡 **USER COMMAND**: If the volume of this log is too high, tell me: **"Gravitas, scale back logging"** or **"Gravitas, switch to Executive Only"**.

This document is a high-fidelity record of every command, error, and reasoning step taken by the AI Assistant. It is designed to expose "Under the Hood" friction points to help the Human Lead determine model efficacy (Flash vs. Pro).

## [2026-01-04 20:10] - LOG INITIALIZED
- **Task:** Create dual-journaling system.
- **Action:** Created `docs/GRAVITAS_THOUGHT_LOG.md`.
- **Reasoning:** User wants to see "troubles" to inform model selection.
- **Self-Correction/Trouble:** Initially tried to use `multi_replace_file_content` for gitignore but the trailing newline caused a target match failure. Switched to `echo` append for reliability.

## [2026-01-04 20:12] - REORGANIZATION FLOW
- **Action:** Updating `docs/GRAVITAS_DEV_JOURNAL.md` to establish the new "Executive" role.
- **Thought:** The Executive Journal should be "Human-Ready" for quick reading. The Thought Log should be "RAG-Ready" and "Forensic-Ready".

## [2026-01-04 20:15] - TOOL EXECUTION FRICTION
- **Issue:** Attempted to edit `.gitignore` using `multi_replace_file_content`.
- **Error:** Target content not found (Likely due to invisible trailing newline or non-unique match range).
- **Recovery:** Pivoted to `echo -e` for the append operation.
- **Learning:** For `.gitignore` and other simple list files, shell append is safer than multi-line character matching.

## [2026-01-04 20:13] - ROADMAP REFINEMENT (DRIVER LATENCY)
- **Decision:** Driver-level instrumentation approved by human lead.
- **Mental Model:** I need to prepare code decorators or context managers that can be wrapped around the `generate_content` and `chat` methods in the L1/L2/L3 drivers.
- **Complexity Check:** Driver-level is more invasive than gateway middleware, but it's the only way to get a "pure" LLM speed metric without the noise of the FastAPI-Uvicorn-Browser stack.

## [2026-01-04 20:16] - MONITOR INTEGRATION (SSE ARCHITECTURE)
- **Decision:** SSE approved for real-time Web UI health streaming.
- **Thought:** Using SSE is significantly lighter than WebSockets for "one-way" data streams like GPU metrics. I'll need to create a fast background task in the FastAPI backend that polls `nvidia-smi` and `docker stats` without blocking the main event loop.
- **Risk:** High-frequency polling of `nvidia-smi` can cause minor overhead; I should aim for a 1-2 second refresh rate to maintain L1 inference performance.

## [2026-01-04 20:18] - LOGGING DEPTH & USER PROTOCOL
- **Drafting Thought:** The user wants "Drafting" notes. This means I should log my internal plan *before* I execute the commands. It adds transparency to my "intent" versus my "execution."
- **Action:** Added the "User Command" header to the top of both journal files.
- **Protocol Update:** From now on, I will start complex task blocks with a "Drafting" entry in this log.
- **Trouble Check:** Ensuring that the `cat` and `sed` operations didn't wipe the file contents. Verifying...

## [2026-01-04 20:21] - HOW-TO DOCUMENTATION SYNC
- **Drafting Thought:** I need to make sure the user knows *exactly* which file is which. I will update the HOWTO to be very explicit about the directory and the naming convention.
- **Action:** Updated `docs/HOWTO_DEV_REMINDERS.md`.
- **Detail:** Defined "The Two Tracks" and added "Volume Control" sections.
- **Self-Correction:** I noticed that the user mentioned "magic words" in their request. I've highlighted them in the documentation so they are easy to find.
