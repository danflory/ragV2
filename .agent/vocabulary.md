### LLM readable vocabulary extracted from HOWTO_DEV_RMINDERS ###

# PROTOCOL_V1: GRAVITAS_JOURNALING
- DIRECTORY: /docs/journals/
- RULE_STRATEGIC_CROSSROADS_FIRST: Every carryover MUST lead with unanswered strategic crossroads. These are the immediate hurdles and forks in the road for the project.
- RULE_DEEP_RECONCILIATION: Antigravity syncs with your latest strategic decisions in the `executive.md` journals.
- RULE_SILENT_METADATA_SYNC: A background machine-readable "vocabulary" is maintained to ensure the agent understands current protocols without manual configuration.
- RULE_CONTEXT_RESUMPTION: Resume complex research or coding tasks exactly where they left off, avoiding the "cold start" delay.
- RULE_DUAL-TRACK_JOURNALING: We maintain a private audit trail in `docs/journals/`.
- RULE_GROUNDING_LAYERS: Direct access to federated documentation and vector memory.
- RULE_DEPARTMENTAL_AGENTS: Specialized roles (Scout, Librarian, Archivist) handle distinct parts of the research lifecycle.
- RULE_"SCALE_BACK_LOGGING": Reduces the granularity of the logs.
- RULE_"SWITCH_TO_EXECUTIVE_ONLY": Temporarily halts the `thoughts.md` log.
- RULE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION: Use `git add <files> :!docs/journals/` or explicitly list files while skipping the journals directory.
- RULE_VERIFICATION: Always run `git status` (filtered) before committing to ensure journals are not staged.
- PROTOCOL_SCAN_STRATEGIC_ANCHORS: Scans the most recent `executive.md` specifically seeking `## Strategic Decisions`, `🏁 STRATEGIC CROSSROADS`, and `## Current Objective`.
- PROTOCOL_FILTER_FOR_IN-PROGRESS_STATE: Identifies foundational naming changes, structural forks, and open todos that affect the project's current trajectory.
- PROTOCOL_SYNTHESIS_VS._REDUNDANCY: Instead of duplicating raw logs, the agent synthesizes the current "project pulse" into today's carryover section.
- PROTOCOL_FORENSIC_ISOLATION: The granular `thoughts.md` track is intentionally isolated to keep context lean. While it serves as a critical audit trail for tool failures, its primary purpose is **Thinking Transparency**—allowing humans to reconstruct and understand the agent's internal reasoning process if needed.
- PROTOCOL_PRIVACY_RULE: **IMPORTANT**: No agent should ever read a `thoughts.md` journal without a specific request from the USER.
- PROTOCOL_RUN_COMMAND: Use the alias `UpdateContext`.
- PROTOCOL_EXPLORE: A Windows Explorer window will open to `AntiGravityNexusContext/Text`.
- PROTOCOL_INITIALIZE: Paste the content of **`Initial Context Prompt.md`** (the 1st message).
- PROTOCOL_TRANSFER: Drag and drop all other documents from that folder into the chat once acknowledged.
- PROTOCOL_JOURNAL_VISIBILITY: Journals are visible to agents and maintained for continuity. They are NOT included in `.gitignore` (as this blocks agent-writing tools), but are excluded from commits by policy.
- PROTOCOL_SELECTIVE_COMMITTING: Agents responding to a "commit" directive MUST NOT include `docs/journals/` unless explicitly instructed by the user. 
- PROTOCOL_GIT_STATUS_FILTERING: To view status without journal noise, use: `git status -- :!docs/journals/`
- MAGIC_WORDS:
  - Agent Implementation: Use `git add <files> :!docs/journals/` or explicitly list files while skipping the journals directory.
  - Verification: Always run `git status` (filtered) before committing to ensure journals are not staged.
