### LLM readable vocabulary extracted from HOWTO_DEV_RMINDERS ###

# PROTOCOL_V1: GRAVITAS_JOURNALING
- DIRECTORY: /docs/journals/
- RULE_STRATEGIC_CROSSROADS_FIRST: Every carryover MUST lead with unanswered strategic crossroads. These are the immediate hurdles and forks in the road for the project.
- RULE_DEEP_RECONCILIATION: Antigravity syncs with your latest strategic decisions in the most recent executive journal.
- RULE_SILENT_METADATA_SYNC: A background machine-readable "vocabulary" is maintained to ensure the agent understands current protocols without manual configuration.
- RULE_CONTEXT_RESUMPTION: Resume complex research or coding tasks exactly where they left off, avoiding the "cold start" delay.
- RULE_DUAL-TRACK_JOURNALING: We maintain a private audit trail in `docs/journals/`.
- RULE_GROUNDING_LAYERS: Direct access to federated documentation and vector memory.
- RULE_DEPARTMENTAL_AGENTS: Specialized roles (Scout, Librarian, Archivist) handle distinct parts of the research lifecycle.
- RULE_"SCALE_BACK_LOGGING": Reduces the granularity of the logs.
- RULE_"SWITCH_TO_EXECUTIVE_ONLY": Temporarily halts the Reasoning Pipe log.
- RULE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION: Use `git add <files> :!docs/journals/` or explicitly list files while skipping the journals directory.
- RULE_VERIFICATION: Always run `git status` (filtered) before committing to ensure journals are not staged.
- PROTOCOL_SCAN_STRATEGIC_ANCHORS: Scans the most recent `executive.md` specifically seeking `## Strategic Decisions`, `🏁 STRATEGIC CROSSROADS`, and `## Current Objective`.
- PROTOCOL_FILTER_FOR_IN-PROGRESS_STATE: Identifies foundational naming changes, structural forks, and open todos that affect the project's current trajectory.
- PROTOCOL_SYNTHESIS_VS._REDUNDANCY: Instead of duplicating raw logs, the agent synthesizes the current "project pulse" into today's carryover section.
- PROTOCOL_REASONING_ISOLATION: The granular `thoughts.md` track is intentionally isolated to keep context lean. While it serves as a critical audit trail for tool failures, its primary purpose is **Thinking Transparency**—allowing humans to reconstruct and understand the agent's internal reasoning process if needed.
- PROTOCOL_PRIVACY_RULE: **IMPORTANT**: No agent should ever read a Reasoning Pipe journal without a specific request from the USER.
- TERM_TELEMETRY: (Strictly Reserved) Gravitas machine performance data (Load Times, VRAM, Latency). 60-day history.
- TERM_REASONING_PIPE: (Strictly Reserved) Agent internal logic, reasoning, and action logs. 14-day history.
- PROTOCOL_REASONING_PIPE_NAMING: Journals for departmental agents MUST follow: `docs/journals/ReasoningPipe_{agentName}.md`.
- PROTOCOL_RUN_COMMAND: Use the alias `UpdateContext`.
- PROTOCOL_EXPLORE: A Windows Explorer window will open to `AntiGravityNexusContext/Text`.
- PROTOCOL_INITIALIZE: Paste the content of **`Initial Context Prompt.md`** (the 1st message).
- PROTOCOL_TRANSFER: Drag and drop all other documents from that folder into the chat once acknowledged.
- PROTOCOL_JOURNAL_VISIBILITY: Journals are visible to agents and maintained for continuity. They are NOT included in `.gitignore` (as this blocks agent-writing tools), but are excluded from commits by policy.
- PROTOCOL_SELECTIVE_COMMITTING: Agents responding to a "commit" directive MUST NOT include `docs/journals/` unless explicitly instructed by the user. 
- PROTOCOL_GIT_STATUS_FILTERING: To view status without journal noise, use: `git status -- :!docs/journals/`
- PROTOCOL_THE_REASONING_PIPE_RULE: MANDATORY. Every task cycle MUST conclude with a verbatim dump of all internal reasoning/actions to the current_session.md buffer.
- PROTOCOL_MECHANICAL_COGNITION: (THE HOOD) Every significant internal reasoning block MUST be wrapped in `<thought_tap>` tags. This creates a machine-parseable "hood" for external logging and audit.
- PROTOCOL_FORENSIC_SCHEMA: Internal thought dumps MUST use the '[itj-XXX]' prefix and categorical markers (Internal Monologue, Drafting Thought, Action, Status).
- PROTOCOL_THE_FIRST_RULE: During urgent fixes, Antigravity is strictly forbidden from modifying any file unrelated to the specific target task.
- PROTOCOL_ZERO-EDITING_POLICY: The agent is strictly forbidden from summarizing, re-phrasing, or "cleaning up" internal processes for the pipe. The dump must be a character-for-character mirror of the internal reasoning or action state.
- PROTOCOL_THE_OBSERVER_BARRIER: Reasoning Pipes are for audit and self-learning only. Agents do not "read" their own session journals to maintain logic; they rely on the active context. This prevents recursion and memory pollution.
- PROTOCOL_BLUEPRINT_REFERENCE: Use the structure defined in `.agent/executive_template.md`.
- PROTOCOL_ACTION/REASONING_SPLIT: Always separate technical changes from architectural rationale.
- PROTOCOL_STRATEGIC_CROSSROADS: Mandatory section for identifying forks/hurdles for human steering.
- PROTOCOL_NO_STATUS_REPORTS: Always favor strategy extraction over "done" lists.
- PROTOCOL_THE_DEFAULT_SUBJECT: Use of the word **"agent"** alone is assumed to refer to **Antigravity** (the active coding/orchestration assistant).
- PROTOCOL_THE_"GRAVITAS"_PREFIX: Every departmental agent MUST include "Gravitas" in its name and documentation descriptions (e.g., **Gravitas Scout**, **Gravitas Librarian**, **Gravitas Archivist**). 
- PROTOCOL_INTERNAL_REFERENCE_RULE: If the prefix is missing, assume the topic is Antigravity. However, using the prefix for Gravitas Agents is a strictly enforced best practice for forensic clarity.
- MAGIC_WORDS:
  - Agent Implementation: Use `git add <files> :!docs/journals/` or explicitly list files while skipping the journals directory.
  - Verification: Always run `git status` (filtered) before committing to ensure journals are not staged.
- PROTOCOL_SHORT_CIRCUIT_HI: (PRIORITY OVERRIDE) If user input is exactly "hi" (case-insensitive), the Agent MUST IMMEDIATELY respond with "hi" and bypass all other reconnaissance/read protocols.
- PROTOCOL_AESTHETIC_ACCESSIBILITY: All UI/UX changes MUST prioritize high-contrast readability. 
- PROTOCOL_TABLE_VISIBILITY_OVERRIDE: (MANDATORY) Due to UI rendering bugs, all table requests MUST be handled by:
  - [1] Prompting the user with an explanation of the bug.
  - [2] Generating a date-stamped .md file in `/temporaryTesting/`.
  - [3] Providing the "Non-Interpreted" raw Markdown in a code block within the chat.
- RECON_PRIORITY: [1] Load .agent/vocabulary.md [2] Exec.md (tail 50) [3] Ready
- PROTOCOL_SESSION_INITIALIZATION: (MANDATORY) Upon receiving the very first prompt of a new session, the Agent MUST immediately execute `python3 ANTIGRAVITY_Scripts/reasoning_pipe.py` before processing the user's request.
