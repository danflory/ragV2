# Link Shell Extension (LSE) Documentation

## Overview

The **NTFS file system** supports a facility known as **Hardlinks**. Hardlinks provide the ability to keep a single copy of a file yet have it appear in multiple folders (directories). Standard Windows facilities for creating these (like `fsutil` or POSIX `ln`) are limited to the command prompt, which can be tedious.

**Link Shell Extension (LSE)** allows for the creation of Hardlinks, Junctions, Volume Mountpoints, and Symbolic Links (collectively referred to as **Links**) via Windows Explorer. It creates a folder cloning process that utilizes Hardlinks or Symbolic Links and a copy process that takes care of Junctions, Symbolic Links, and Hardlinks.

### Supported Platforms

* **Windows Versions:** Windows 7, 8, and 10 (and Legacy support for NT4/2000/XP).
* **File Systems:** NTFS (Required for Hardlinks/Junctions). FAT file systems are **not** supported.

## Using Link Shell Extension

### Basic Usage: Pick and Drop

The core functionality relies on a "Copy/Paste" metaphor using the Context Menu (Right-Click).

1. **Pick Link Source:** Select the file(s) or folder(s) you want to link *from*. Right-click and select **Pick Link Source**.
2. **Drop As...:** Navigate to the destination folder. Right-click and select **Drop As...**
3. **Select Link Type:** Choose from Hardlink, Junction, Symbolic Link, Clone, etc.

> **Note:** To cancel a pending operation, right-click the background of a folder and select **Cancel Link Creation**.

### Feature Breakdown

#### 1. Hardlinks

* **Definition:** Keeps a single copy of a file appearing in multiple folders. Changes to one affect all.
* **Creation:** Pick file(s) -> Drop As -> **Hardlink**.
* **Auto Rename:** LSE handles naming conflicts by appending ` - Hardlink (n)` if creating a link in the same folder.
* **Icons:** Adds a customizable "Red Arrow" overlay to distinguish hardlinks.

#### 2. Junctions

* **Definition:** Linkages among directories (folders).
* **Creation:** Pick folder -> Drop As -> **Junction**.
* **Icons:** Marked with a chain link overlay.
* **Network Support:** Can target mapped network drives (though UNC paths may have limitations in standard Explorer).

#### 3. Symbolic Links

* **Definition:** Transparent pathways to data objects. Unlike Hardlinks, these can span different volumes.
* **Support:** Windows 7/8/10.
* **Creation:** Pick file/folder -> Drop As -> **Symbolic Link**.
* **Relative vs Absolute:** LSE defaults to **Relative** links if possible. This can be toggled in the configuration.
* **Privileges:** Requires Elevation (UAC) unless "Developer Mode" is enabled in Windows 10 or specific Group Policies are set (`SE_CREATE_SYMBOLIC_LINK_NAME`).

#### 4. Smart Copy

Creates a copy of a directory structure while preserving the inner hardlink structure and inner junction/symbolic link relations.

* **Saturated Hardlinks:** If a file is hardlinked multiple times *within* the source folder structure, Smart Copy preserves these links in the destination.
* **Unsaturated Hardlinks:** If a file is linked to a file *outside* the source folder, the link is broken in the copy (it becomes a distinct file).
* **Command Line:** `ln.exe --copy`

#### 5. Smart Move

Allows renaming or moving folders containing complex links. LSE intercepts the move operation to update Junction/Symlink targets so links do not break.

#### 6. Clones (Hardlink or Symbolic)

Replicates a folder tree structure where the files within are **Links** to the original files, not copies.

* **Hardlink Clone:** Uses minimal disk space; limited to the same NTFS volume.
* **Symbolic Link Clone:** Can span volumes.

#### 7. Smart Mirror

Synchronizes a Source folder to a Destination.

* Copies items with different timestamps.
* Deletes items in Destination not present in Source.
* Preserves Hardlink/Junction relations.

#### 8. DeLorean Copy (Incremental Backup)

Uses Hardlink Cloning to create versioned backups.

1. **Phase 1:** Initial Smart Copy.
2. **Phase 2 (Subsequent drops):** Hardlink Clones the previous backup (taking almost no space).
3. **Phase 3:** Mirrors the current source changes into the new backup.

* *Result:* Each backup folder looks full and complete, but unchanged files share data on the disk via hardlinks.

## Advanced Handling

### Outer Junctions / Symbolic Links

When copying a folder that contains links pointing *outside* that folder ("Outer Links"), LSE offers three handling methods:

1. **Crop:** Breaks the link. The destination will not contain the linked folder.
2. **Unroll (Default):** Follows the link and copies the *content* of the target into the destination.
3. **Splice:** Creates a new junction/link in the destination pointing back to the *original* target.

### Backup Mode

Enables copying of ACLs (permissions) and Encrypted Files, even without standard access rights.

* **Requirement:** User needs `SE_BACKUP_NAME` and `SE_RESTORE_NAME` privileges.
* **Usage:** Useful for SmartCopy, SmartMirror, and DeLorean Copy.

### Remote Capabilities (SMB)

LSE supports creating Remote Hardlinks, Junctions, and Symlinks within SMB mapped network NTFS drives.

* *Note:* SMB 2.0+ does not support identifying if a remote file is a hardlink, so overlay icons may not appear on remote drives.

---

## Configuration Tool (`LSEConfig`)

LSE includes a configuration utility to tweak settings:

* **Language:** Switch UI language.
* **Smart Move:** Enable/Disable.
* **Remote Capabilities:** Disable to improve Explorer performance on slow networks.
* **Outer Link Handling:** Set default to Crop, Unroll, or Splice.
* **Symlink Creation:** Force Relative or Absolute.
* **Overlay Icons:** Customize icons, change priorities, or disable them.

---

## Command Line Utility (`ln.exe`)

LSE includes a command line tool equivalent to the GUI features.

| Feature | Switch |
| --- | --- |
| **Smart Copy** | `ln.exe --copy` |
| **Smart Move** | `ln.exe --move` |
| **Clone** | `ln.exe --recursive` |
| **List Hardlinks** | `ln.exe --enum` or `--list` |
| **DeLorean Copy** | `ln.exe` (context dependent) |
| **Probe Filesystem** | `ln.exe --probefs x:` |

---

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: Explorer shows "The specified path does not exist" when clicking a Symlink to an .exe.**

* **A:** This is a known Explorer bug. It works via command prompt or third-party file managers.

**Q: Overlay icons do not show up.**

* **A:** Windows limits the number of Overlay Handlers (11 slots in Win10). Other apps (like Dropbox) may have pushed LSE out. You can manually boost priority in the Registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers` by prepending spaces to the LSE entry names.

**Q: Smart Move isn't working on Read-Only folders.**

* **A:** If a `desktop.ini` specifies a LocalizedResourceName and the folder is read-only, Explorer fails to call the hook. This is an Explorer bug.

**Q: Can I use this on ReFS?**

* **A:** Yes, LSE supports ReFS (which gained Hardlink support in v3.5).

#Summary
---
---
The tool you are describing is **Link Shell Extension** (LSE).

It is a widely used Windows utility that integrates into File Explorer to make creating complex file system links (like symbolic links, hard links, and junctions) accessible via a simple right-click menu, avoiding the need for the command line.

### How it matches your description:

* **"Pick Link Source"**: This is the first option you select on the file or folder you want to link *from*. It effectively "copies" the path to the tool's internal clipboard.
* **"Drop As..."**: When you right-click in the destination folder, this menu appears, offering options like **Symbolic Link**, **Junction**, **Hardlink**, **Smart Copy**, and **Clones**.

### Key Features

* **Symbolic Links (Symlinks):** Acts like a shortcut but is treated by the system as the actual file/folder. Useful for moving bulky folders (like game data or application caches) to a different drive while tricking the software into thinking it's still in the original location.
* **Hard Links:** Creates a directory entry that points to the exact same data on the disk as the original file. If you delete one, the file data remains until all hard links are deleted.
* **Junctions:** Similar to symbolic links but specifically for directories; often used for redirecting folders within the same local computer.

### Where to find it

The tool is maintained by Hermann Schinagl. It is free to download, though the website retains a very "classic" simpler internet aesthetic.
